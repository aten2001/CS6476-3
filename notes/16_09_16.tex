\subsubsection{Fitting and Alignment Methods}
Hough Transform and RANSAC are the more commonly used ones.
\paragraph{Hough Transform} Pros, cons, common applications - review of previous lecture.
\paragraph{RANSAC}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Sample a randome number of points - usually the minimum number of points required to fit the model.
	\item Solve for the model using the samples.
	\item Score the model by computing how many points in the data agree with the model (ie, how many inliers).
	\item Repeat 1-3 until best model within a confidence is found	
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Alignment} Find a global set of parameters that would let you apply a transformation on an image (ie, a global parametric transformation) and transform it into another image. NOTE: Global here refers to that the parameter is independent of the point.
