\subsubsection{Harris Detector}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Second moment matrix
	\item Cornerness function - tuning $\alpha$ tunes the cornerness of the edges
\end{itemize}
Orientation normalization

\subsubsection{Local features}
\paragraph{How do we describe the image around the keypoints?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Templates - use image patches as features directly
	\item Histogram - represent distribution of features, color intensity, texture, ...
	\item SIFT features - It takes a histogram of gradients in each 4x4 cell of the image gradient matrix(16x16) - keypoint descriptor
	\item SURF descriptor (variation on SIFT): Instead of 4x4 binning, use a log-polar binning.
	\item Self-similarity descriptor
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Reducing the effect of illumination}
128 vectors normalized to 1. 128 = (4x4) bin matrix and each bin(or cell) has 8 directions to describe the histogram of gradients.
\paragraph{Nearest neighbor distance ratio} helps you determine the confidence of the similarity distance. If there is a large difference between the closest match and the next closest match, it's more confident.
